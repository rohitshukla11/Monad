 *     licensed when it was made, by construction.
 *  2. The C2PA manifest, if any: which licence it claims, whether its signature holds, who signed.
 *  3. The licence's status now:
 *       Active / Exhausted → Licensed
 *       Expired            → Expired (licensed when made, licence period over)
 *       Revoked            → Revoked (licensed when made, since revoked), with when and how
 *     No receipt for these bytes → Unknown, even if a manifest claims a licence (edited, re-encoded,
 *     or never paid for). A hash alone (no file) checks the receipt only.
